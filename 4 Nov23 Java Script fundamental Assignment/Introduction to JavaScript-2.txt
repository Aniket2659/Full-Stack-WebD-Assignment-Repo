Q1. Explain the role of operators in JavaScript. Why are they essential in programming?

Answer : Operators in JavaScript are symbols that represent computations or actions performed on variables and values. They play a crucial role in programming by allowing developers to manipulate and perform operations on data. Here are some key aspects of the role of operators in JavaScript:

1. **Arithmetic Operations:**
   - Operators like `+` (addition), `-` (subtraction), `*` (multiplication), `/` (division), and `%` (modulo) allow you to perform basic arithmetic operations on numeric values.

2. **Comparison Operations:**
   - Comparison operators such as `==` (equal), `===` (strict equal), `!=` (not equal), `!==` (strict not equal), `<` (less than), `>` (greater than), `<=` (less than or equal to), and `>=` (greater than or equal to) are used to compare values and return a Boolean result.

3. **Logical Operations:**
   - Logical operators like `&&` (logical AND), `||` (logical OR), and `!` (logical NOT) are used to perform logical operations on Boolean values. They are fundamental for creating conditions and controlling the flow of a program.

4. **Assignment Operations:**
   - The assignment operator (`=`) is used to assign a value to a variable. Compound assignment operators like `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, and `/=` combine an operation with assignment, making code more concise.

5. **Unary Operations:**
   - Unary operators operate on a single operand. Examples include the unary plus (`+`) and unary minus (`-`), which can convert a variable to a number and change the sign of a numeric value, respectively.

6. **String Operations:**
   - The `+` operator is used for string concatenation, allowing you to combine multiple strings into a single string.

Operators are essential in programming because they provide the building blocks for expressing complex computations and logic. They enable developers to perform mathematical calculations, make decisions based on conditions, manipulate data, and control the flow of a program. The use of operators contributes to the expressiveness and versatility of programming languages, allowing developers to create efficient and powerful algorithms.



Q2. Describe the categorization of operators in JavaScript based on their functionality. Provide examples for
each category.
Answer : Operators in JavaScript can be categorized based on their functionality. Here are some common categories with examples:

1. **Arithmetic Operators:**
   - Perform basic mathematical operations.
   ```javascript
   let a = 5;
   let b = 2;

   console.log(a + b); // Addition: 7
   console.log(a - b); // Subtraction: 3
   console.log(a * b); // Multiplication: 10
   console.log(a / b); // Division: 2.5
   console.log(a % b); // Modulo: 1
   ```

2. **Comparison Operators:**
   - Compare values and return a Boolean result.
   ```javascript
   let x = 10;
   let y = 5;

   console.log(x == y);  // Equal: false
   console.log(x != y);  // Not Equal: true
   console.log(x > y);   // Greater Than: true
   console.log(x < y);   // Less Than: false
   console.log(x >= y);  // Greater Than or Equal: true
   console.log(x <= y);  // Less Than or Equal: false
   ```

3. **Logical Operators:**
   - Perform logical operations on Boolean values.
   ```javascript
   let p = true;
   let q = false;

   console.log(p && q); // Logical AND: false
   console.log(p || q); // Logical OR: true
   console.log(!p);     // Logical NOT: false
   ```

4. **Assignment Operators:**
   - Assign values to variables.
   ```javascript
   let num = 10;

   num += 5;  // num = num + 5
   num -= 3;  // num = num - 3
   num *= 2;  // num = num * 2
   num /= 4;  // num = num / 4

   console.log(num); // 7
   ```

5. **Unary Operators:**
   - Operate on a single operand.
   ```javascript
   let counter = 0;

   counter++;   // Increment by 1
   counter--;   // Decrement by 1
   let isNegative = -counter;
   ```

6. **String Operators:**
   - Concatenate strings.
   ```javascript
   let firstName = "John";
   let lastName = "Doe";

   let fullName = firstName + " " + lastName;
   console.log(fullName); // "John Doe"
   ```

These categories cover a broad range of operations, allowing developers to perform various tasks in JavaScript by combining and using operators appropriately in their code.



Q3. Differentiate between unary, binary, and ternary operators in JavaScript. Give examples of each.

Answer : In JavaScript, operators can be classified based on the number of operands they act upon:

1. **Unary Operators:**
   - Unary operators operate on a single operand.
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     let x = 5;
     let y = -x; // Unary minus operator
     console.log(y); // -5
     ```

   - Another example using the increment (++), and decrement (--) operators:
     ```javascript
     let count = 0;
     count++; // Unary increment operator
     console.log(count); // 1

     count--; // Unary decrement operator
     console.log(count); // 0
     ```

2. **Binary Operators:**
   - Binary operators operate on two operands.
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     let a = 5;
     let b = 3;
     let sum = a + b; // Binary addition operator
     console.log(sum); // 8
     ```

   - Other examples include arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /), comparison operators (==, !=, >, <, >=, <=), and logical operators (&&, ||).

3. **Ternary Operator:**
   - The ternary operator is the only operator in JavaScript that takes three operands. It's a shorthand for an if-else statement.
   - Syntax: `condition ? expressionIfTrue : expressionIfFalse`
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     let age = 20;
     let isAdult = age >= 18 ? "Yes" : "No";
     console.log(isAdult); // "Yes"
     ```

   - The above code is equivalent to:
     ```javascript
     let age = 20;
     let isAdult;
     if (age >= 18) {
       isAdult = "Yes";
     } else {
       isAdult = "No";
     }
     console.log(isAdult); // "Yes"
     ```

In summary:
- **Unary operators** work on a single operand.
- **Binary operators** work on two operands.
- The **ternary operator** is a shorthand for an if-else statement and works on three operands.




Q4. Discuss the precedence and associativity of operators in JavaScript. Why is understanding these concepts
important?

Answer : Understanding the precedence and associativity of operators in JavaScript is crucial for writing code that behaves as expected. These concepts determine the order in which operators are evaluated when multiple operators are used in a single expression.

### Precedence:
Operator precedence defines the order in which operators are evaluated in an expression. Operators with higher precedence are evaluated first. For example, multiplication has a higher precedence than addition.

Here are some examples of operator precedence in JavaScript:

1. **High Precedence:**
   - Multiplication (`*`), Division (`/`), Modulo (`%`)
   - Unary operators (`+`, `-`, `++`, `--`, `!`)

2. **Medium Precedence:**
   - Addition (`+`), Subtraction (`-`)

3. **Low Precedence:**
   - Comparison operators (`<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`, `==`, `===`, `!=`, `!==`)
   - Logical AND (`&&`), Logical OR (`||`)

### Associativity:
Associativity determines the grouping of operators with the same precedence. It can be left-to-right or right-to-left.

1. **Left-to-Right Associativity:**
   - Most operators in JavaScript are left-to-right associative.
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     let result = 5 - 2 + 1; // ((5 - 2) + 1) = 4
     ```

2. **Right-to-Left Associativity:**
   - The assignment operator (`=`) is right-to-left associative.
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     let a = 5;
     let b = 2;
     let c = a = b; // The assignment is right-to-left: a = (b), then c = (a)
     console.log(c); // 2
     ```

### Importance of Understanding Precedence and Associativity:

1. **Correctness of Expressions:**
   - Understanding precedence ensures that expressions are evaluated in the intended order. Without this knowledge, the result may not be as expected.

2. **Code Readability:**
   - Proper use of parentheses and awareness of operator precedence make code more readable. It helps convey the developer's intention clearly to others who read the code.

3. **Avoiding Bugs:**
   - Incorrect assumptions about precedence can lead to bugs that are challenging to identify and fix. Explicitly using parentheses when needed can help avoid such issues.

4. **Efficient Coding:**
   - Knowing the precedence allows for more concise and efficient code by eliminating the need for unnecessary parentheses in expressions.

In summary, understanding operator precedence and associativity is essential for writing correct, readable, and efficient JavaScript code. It ensures that expressions are evaluated in the expected order and helps prevent common pitfalls in programming.


Q5. Write a JavaScript program that calculates the simple interest using the formula Simple interest =
(principal * rate * time) / 100.

Answer : 

Certainly! Here's a simple JavaScript program that calculates the simple interest based on the provided formula:

```javascript
// Function to calculate simple interest
function calculateSimpleInterest(principal, rate, time) {
  // Simple interest formula: (principal * rate * time) / 100
  return (principal * rate * time) / 100;
}

// Example values
let principalAmount = 1000;  // Principal amount in dollars
let interestRate = 5;       // Annual interest rate in percentage
let timePeriod = 2;         // Time period in years

// Calculate simple interest using the function
let interest = calculateSimpleInterest(principalAmount, interestRate, timePeriod);

// Display the result
console.log(`Simple Interest: $${interest.toFixed(2)}`);
```

In this example:
- The `calculateSimpleInterest` function takes three parameters: `principal` (the initial amount of money), `rate` (the annual interest rate), and `time` (the time the money is invested or borrowed in years).
- The function returns the calculated simple interest.
- The example values are provided for the principal amount, interest rate, and time period.
- The result is displayed using `console.log`.

You can modify the values of `principalAmount`, `interestRate`, and `timePeriod` to test the program with different inputs.



Q6. Write a Javascript program to calculate the Body Mass Index (BMI) using the formula BMI = weight (kg)/
height * height.

Answer : Certainly! Here's a simple JavaScript program that calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) using the provided formula:

```javascript
// Function to calculate BMI
function calculateBMI(weight, height) {
  // BMI formula: weight (kg) / (height * height)
  return weight / (height * height);
}

// Example values
let weightKg = 70;     // Weight in kilograms
let heightMeters = 1.75;  // Height in meters

// Calculate BMI using the function
let bmi = calculateBMI(weightKg, heightMeters);

// Display the result
console.log(`Weight: ${weightKg} kg`);
console.log(`Height: ${heightMeters} meters`);
console.log(`BMI: ${bmi.toFixed(2)}`);
```

In this example:
- The `calculateBMI` function takes two parameters: `weight` (in kilograms) and `height` (in meters).
- The function returns the calculated BMI.
- Example values are provided for the weight and height.
- The result, BMI, is displayed using `console.log`.

You can modify the values of `weightKg` and `heightMeters` to test the program with different inputs. Keep in mind that BMI is a simple measure and may not be a perfect indicator of health as it does not differentiate between muscle and fat.



Q7. Write a program in JavaScript to calculate the area of a circle given its radius value of 10. Use appropriate
arithmetic operators.

Answer : Certainly! Here's a simple JavaScript program to calculate the area of a circle given its radius:

```javascript
// Function to calculate the area of a circle
function calculateCircleArea(radius) {
  // Area formula: π * r^2
  const pi = Math.PI;
  return pi * radius * radius;
}

// Example radius value
let radius = 10;

// Calculate the area using the function
let area = calculateCircleArea(radius);

// Display the result
console.log(`Radius: ${radius}`);
console.log(`Area of the circle: ${area.toFixed(2)}`);
```

In this example:
- The `calculateCircleArea` function takes one parameter, `radius`, which represents the radius of the circle.
- The function uses the formula for the area of a circle: \( \pi \times \text{{radius}}^2 \), where \( \pi \) is a constant provided by `Math.PI`.
- The result, the area of the circle, is displayed using `console.log`.

You can change the value of the `radius` variable to calculate the area for a circle with a different radius.
